				<h2>
				Background
				</h2>
				As part of the module requirements of the Progamming for Geographic Information Analysis module, students were required to construct an Agent Based Modelling Programme.
				This website, shows my solition to this programming task. In addition to a link to my GitHub repository where the final code is hosted, this website will discuss details of
				the programme. You are invited to copy my code as you wish, though I kindly request that you credit me if you do so.
				<h2>
				Agent Based Modelling
				</h2>
				An agent based model, is a type of program which allows developers to create objects with the same attribute types and behaviours; while allowing
				them to behave independantly within the model. Notwithstanding this, the agents may also interact with eat other, agents of different types and a virtual environment.
				<br>
				In this context an agent, is simply a data object designed to represent a thing. The thing itself, can be real or virtual. Such as a person moving about an area or a
				computer game character, in a virtual world.
				<br>
				Through flow control programing the developer is able to control how many agents or created, when they are created and/or destroyed and how and when their behaviours
				are activated; including any interaction with the enviroment or other agents.
				<br>
				The task of this project, was to develop an agent based model which creates multiple agents and causes the to move about an environment set set number of times. Following
				each movement the agent this "eats" the environemnt it stops; thereby reducing the environment value and increasing it's store value by the same fixed amount or whatever is left in the
				enviroment whichever is less. In my model, agents coming into close proximety with each other will also equally share there stores.
				<br>
				The completed project consists of two main files (in the root of the respository), plus additional files for testing and from various stages of progress through the module (in the archive folder). All files are listed below and can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/jamiee7/jamiee7.github.io"> my GitHub Repository</a>.

				Repository Contents
				</h2>
				<ul>
					<li> ABM_animate_gui.py - The final model which I created for the project</li>
					<li> agentframework.py - A python script, containing the Agent Class which is called in the final model</li>
					<li> in.txt - The enviroment which the agents move around in</li>
				</ul>
				Other files should be ignored.
